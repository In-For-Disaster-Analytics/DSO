Planet Texas 2050 (PT2050) has partnered with REDI to create a knowledge center for resilience studies and applications. The research efforts span disciplines to touch the outer limits of our knowledge and attempt to connect theory with practice. Our ultimate aim is to catalyze a new understanding of the choices and options our state must endeavor to navigate in the hope of achieving our collective best possible future.  

The PTDataX  component of the PT2050 program aim to design and build data systems and integrated modeling capabilities that connect with leading-edge, high-performance computing facilities. The cyberinfrastructure research prioritizes the development of compute capabilities such that technology is reusable, scalable, and understandable by non-traditional advanced computing user groups and continues to be helpful to advanced HPC users in the PT2050 community.  Core services for data and models are designed to meet operational levels that are reliable for researchers.
